				<h2>About the project</h2>
				<p>As years pass by, technology has become part of our education system with many kids and students starting learning using applications or websites that help them improve their knowledge. We decided to create a website that helps kids learn English with the help of implementing HTML, CSS, Java script, PHP, MySQL, Web server that we learnt throughout the semester from Dr. Md. Shohel Sayeed. On our website, we have a way for kids to learn basic English like the Alphabets, Story Telling, and Spell it.
				</p>
				<h2>Objectives of the project</h2>
				<p>Our objective is to find a balance between education and entertainment for children who are learning English. With our Website, Children will be able to enjoy simple yet effective methods of learning with videos, tests, and activities that score them based on their results.</p>
